# What is this?
Here you will find some supplemental materials to my PhD application that were perhaps not suitable to include in the application itself, but may be of some interest if you are looking to know more details about my previous work. The filenames should be self-explanatory, but here is a descriptive directory of everything I've hosted here:

## Carnegie Mellon University
* [cmu_senior_honors_thesis.pdf](cmu_senior_honors_thesis.pdf)
A copy of my senior honors thesis titled "Deepening the Automated Search for Gödel's Proofs".

* [goedel_poster_MoM2011.pdf](goedel_poster_MoM2011.pdf)
I presented this poster at the 2011 Meeting of the Minds Undergraduate Research Symposium at Carnegie Mellon University to share my research regarding computer verification of Gödel's incompleteness theorems.

* [proofs_poster_MoM2010.pdf](proofs_poster_MoM2010.pdf)
I presented this poster at the 2010 Meeting of the Minds Undergraduate Research Symposium at Carnegie Mellon University to disseminate my findings from my research regarding the intelligibility of formal proofs.

## United States Patent and Trademark Office
* [patents_granted_by_me.pdf](patents_granted_by_me.pdf)
A list of 15 patents granted by me while I was a Patent Examiner in computer science for the USPTO. The titles and abstracts illustrate the breadth of the art I examined in and give you an idea of the sort of technologies I had to gain conceptual mastery over in order to determine the novelty of  claimed inventions.

## DePaul University 
* [depaul_csc587_cogsci_ideas.pdf](depaul_csc587_cogsci_ideas.pdf)
For Professor Clark Elliott's graduate cognitive science class at DePaul University, we were required to maintain an "Ideas File", a free-form document that no one would read but Professor Elliott in which we could write about whatever came to mind and furthered our research in the class. I filled mine with nearly 15,000 words of random musings on artificial intelligence, machine learning, self-organization, computability theory, all kinds of fun stuff. Obviously, don't read the whole thing, but take a peek to see where my head wanders when I'm told to write freely about cognitive science.

* [echo_state_network.py](echo_state_network.py)
An Echo State Network implementation in Python I was working on to recognize causal structure in English sentences (initiated to assist Dr. Peter Hastings at DePaul University in his research). This project was set aside once I started working full-time in addition to being a full-time student, so no definitive results were obtained.

* [echo_state_network_notes.pdf](echo_state_network_notes.pdf)
A partial research log documenting some of my ideas regarding my Echo State Network implementation, as well as a list of papers I read in preparation for engaging in this research.
