# What is this?
Here you will find some supplemental materials to my PhD application that were perhaps not suitable to include in the application itself, but may be of some interest if you are looking to know more details about my previous work. The filenames should be self-explanatory, but here is a descriptive directory of everything I've hosted here:

1. **patents_granted_by_me.pdf**
A list of 15 patents granted by me while I was a Patent Examiner for the USPTO. The titles and abstracts illustrate the breadth of the art I examined in and give you an idea of the sort of technologies I had to gain conceptual mastery over in order to determine the novelty of the claimed inventions.
